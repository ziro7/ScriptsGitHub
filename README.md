My very own RPG game.

It is a story of an Angel that is being send to clean up the evil in the world. 

To prove its worth weapon and abilities is taken from the angel, but will be given back if proven worthy (by killing evil and levelinging up).

Trying to do a full game with bosses, abilities, weapon effects, melee/ranged/magical weapons, progression etc.

It is not expected to be published at any point, but will be where I have fun trying out things. :)

You are welcome to copy from the scripts if you find them interessting.

Finished the enviroment for now and placed all enemies in 1/2. 
Started working on new AI logic to engage when attacked - but small bug to finish.
